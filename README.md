# 🚦 Ferok Bridge AI Traffic Signal Automation

Welcome! This is a smart traffic signal project built to solve a very real problem faced every day on **Ferok Bridge, Kerala** — endless waiting and frustrating traffic jams.

We’re using **AI and computer vision** to control traffic lights based on real-time vehicle counts from live video feeds. Think of it as giving brains to traffic signals.

## 🧠 Why This Project?

If you’ve ever crossed Ferok Bridge during peak hours, you know the struggle — traffic builds up unevenly, signals don’t adapt, and everyone loses time.

We asked ourselves:  
**"What if signals could see and think?"**

This project is our answer — a traffic signal that *reacts* to actual traffic.

## 🔍 What It Does

- 🎥 **Watches** traffic through live video
- 🚗 **Counts** vehicles on each side of the bridge
- ⏱️ **Decides** signal timing based on vehicle load
- 🚦 **Controls** signals dynamically for better flow
